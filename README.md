I developed a full-stack web application for role-based user management with CRUD functionalities.
The main features included authentication, authorization, and access control where Admins could create, update, and delete user accounts, while normal users had limited access based on their roles. 
On the frontend, I used React.js with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and user-friendly UI. 
On the backend, I implemented APIs using Node.js and Express.js, with MySQL as the relational database for storing user details, roles, and permissions. 
I also integrated JWT-based authentication for secure login and session handling, and implemented role-based middleware in Express.js to restrict API access. 
The key tools and frameworks used were React.js for frontend UI, Node.js & Express.js for backend server and API development, MySQL as my database and JWT & bcrypt.js for authentication and password encryption.
